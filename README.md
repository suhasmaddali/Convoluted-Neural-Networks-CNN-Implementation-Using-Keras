# Convoluted Neural Network CNN implementation using Keras 

In this machine learning project, we are going to be implementing the Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) in order to get predictions respectively. We see that there are a lot of Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) being deployed in various settings. Getting an overview of the networks would ensure that we understand the basics before understanding their working in real-time projects respectively.

We would be using different kernel sizes and this would give us a good indication of the change in the output values based on the predictions respectively.
